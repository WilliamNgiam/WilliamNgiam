## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am Dr William Ngiam, currently a Lecturer in the School of Psychology at the University of Adelaide. I am a cognitive neuroscientist researching how we represent information in both the mind and brain. My lab is called [the Perception, Attention, Learning and Memory Lab or the PALM Lab](https://github.com/PALM-Lab). 

My Github will primarily contain code for cognitive experiments.
